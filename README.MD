# What's this?

This used to be an attempt at a portfolio, but I simply cannot bring myself to design a professional site.

## IT'S JUST SO BLAND AND BORING BLEH

So instead this will be a place for me to experiment and attempt to have some fun, free of any judgment of skills and without any guilt of using tools instead of writing everything from scratch.

Might eventually just host this website myself if it ends up being interesting enough.
