<h1>What's this?</h1>
This used to be an attempt at a portfolio, but I simply cannot bring myself to design a professional site.
<br>
<h2> IT'S JUST SO BLAND AND BORING BLEH</h2>
So instead this will be a place for me to experiment and attempt to have some fun, free of any judgment of skills and without any guilt of using tools instead of writing everything from scratch.
<br>
Might eventually just host this website myself if it ends up being interesting enough.
